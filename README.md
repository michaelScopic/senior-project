# senior-project

This is a little script I made for my senior presentation.

This repository will be deleted (or archived [probably not tho]) soon after finals are finished.

* Note: Because this is a public repository (meaning *anyone* can view this repository), I cannot disclose my full name or the name of my school.

## Installing Python 3

**!!You need Python 3 and up to be able to run this script.!!**

You can download the latest Python version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or with your system's package manager if you know how to do that.

Having trouble installing it? Google is your best friend.

After you have installed Python, you can simply just run the Python script.

* Note: Most Linux distros and macOS hosts usually have Python 3 installed by default. You can check if Python is installed by opening a terminal and running:

```sh
python3 --version 
```

If it gives you an error, then please install Python 3.

## Downloading this repo

If you aren't a developer or tech savy person, you can just [download this repo](https://github.com/michaelScopic/senior-project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the zip.

Or, if you **are** a developer/techie person and have `git` installed, just open a terminal and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/senior-project
```

## Running the presentation

Windows users:

Once you have opened the folder that contians my script in the files explorer, right click on any empty space and click on `Open in Terminal`. Then just run:

```cmd
python main.py
```

### Linux and macOS users

* Note: macOS users can reference the above Windows instructions if you don't feel comfortable changing directories in a terminal. Just be sure to run the command below instead of the Windows command.

Open any terminal and change directory to my script.

Then just run this:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
