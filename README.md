This is a little script I made for my senior presentation.

## Installing Python 3

**You need Python 3 and up to be able to run this script.** You can download the latest Python version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or with your system's package manager if you know how to do that.

Having trouble installing it? Google is your best friend.

After you have installed Python, you can simply just run the Python script.

Optional: If you want to verify that Python was correctly installed, you can open a terminal and run:

```cmd
python --version
```

Or run the line below if you use Linux or macOS:

```sh
python3 --version
```

And it should output the Python version.

## Running my script

Windows users:

Once you have opened the folder that contians my script in the files explorer, right click on any empty space and click on `Open in Terminal`. Then just run:

```cmd
python aboutme.py
```

### Linux and macOS users

- Note: macOS users can reference the above Windows instructions if you don't feel comfortable changing directories in a terminal. Just be sure to run the command below instead of the Windows command.

Open any terminal and change directory to my script.

Then just run this:

```sh
python3 aboutme.py
```
